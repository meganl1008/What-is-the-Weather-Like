# Python API Challenge
Utilize APIs to conduct data analysis on weather

## Part 1: WeatherPy
I will create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ random cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I will be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, to create a representative model of weather across world cities

### Objective #1
<b> Build a series of scatter plots to showcase latitude against the following weather attributes: </b> <br />

<img src = "results/latitude_temp.png" width = "40%">       <img src = "results/latitude_humidity.png" width = "40%"> <br />

<img src = "results/latitude_cloudiness.png" width = "40%"> <img src = "results/latitude_wind.png" width = "40%">

### Objective #2
Run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude): <br />
<b> Example: </b> <br />
<b>This graph shows Northern Hemisphere: Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression </b> <br />
<img src = "results/regression.png" width = "40%">

## Part 2: VacationPy
1. Use the analysis conducted above on weather to plan future vacations

<b> Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from part 1 of the homework </b> <br />
<img src = "results/global_heat_map.png" width = "80%">

2. Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition <br />
For example: <br />
- Max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70
- Wind speed less than 10 mph
- Zero cloudiness <br />
** Drop any rows that donâ€™t contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal <br />

Then use Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates <br />

Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country <br />
