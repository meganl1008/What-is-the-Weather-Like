# Python API Challenge
Utilize APIs to conduct data analysis on weather

## Part 1: WeatherPy
I will create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I will be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, to create a representative model of weather across world cities

### Objective #1
<b> Build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships: </b>

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
